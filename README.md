Weight, extra traction

	• Ensure that the stopping values and IR sensor values are correct (Nava)
	• Change 0x66 and 0x99 values
	• Make sure speed of 0 is acc 0 (watch robot actually making turns to ensure one wheel is stopped)
	• Slow down on tight turns? - have one wheel turn other way??  - go slower on straight surfaces, on tighter turns have the turning wheel go closer to full speed
  • Check over correcting right or left!
